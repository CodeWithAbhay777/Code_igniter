# Code Igniter

NOTE : Under development.

Code Igniter is a collaborative coding platform where users can code together in real time. It supports multiple programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, and more. With Code Igniter, coding with friends and colleagues is easy and efficient, eliminating the hassle of constant screen-sharing or video calls.


## Problem Statement

As someone who frequently helps friends with coding questions, explaining solutions over calls or during meetings with screen-sharing can be time-consuming and tedious. To make collaborative problem-solving easier and more engaging, I created this project. Code Igniter allows users to code, discuss, and learn collaboratively in a single platform.

## Key Features

- **Video Call (WebRTC):** Seamless video communication for live discussions.
- **Real-Time Code Collaboration:** Collaborate on code in real time with support for multiple programming languages.
- **Whiteboard (TL Draw):** Discuss ideas and sketch diagrams in real time using an interactive whiteboard.
- **Chat Feature:** Stay connected even if the video call isn't working.
- **AI Assistant:** Resolve bugs quickly and get AI-powered solutions to coding problems.
- **Code Saving:** Save your code effortlessly using Google Authentication.
- **Easy to Use:** A simple and intuitive interface for seamless collaboration.
- **Expandable:** Built to support more features and programming languages in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth
- **Code Compiler API:** [Piston API](https://piston.rs)
- **Code Editor:** Monaco Editor
- **WebSockets:** Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Whiteboard:** TLDraw
- **Video Call:** WebRTC
- **AI Assistant:** ChatGPT API

## How to Use


1. **Collaborate:** Start a coding session with your friends. Share the session link to join.
2. **Communicate:** Use video calls, chat, and whiteboard features to discuss and work together.
3. **Code Together:** Collaborate on code in real time with support for various programming languages.
4. **Save Work:** Save your code for future reference or debugging sessions.

## Future Plans

- Adding support for more programming languages.
